# LiquidCrystal_SSD1306 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/McNeight/LiquidCrystal_SSD1306.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/McNeight/LiquidCrystal_SSD1306)

Developed by [Neil McNeight](https://github.com/McNeight) based on Arduino and other Open Source libraries.

## Description

Text only library for monochrome organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. For all Arduino boards.

This library allows an Arduino board to control OLED displays based on the SSD1306 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most OLED panels. The library works with an I2C interface, in addition to the reset control line.
It was originally designed to be a small library for ATtiny85-based boards (Trinket, Gemma, etc.) but it is compatible with all Arduino boards.

## Required Libraries

1. Either Wire or [TinyWireM](https://github.com/adafruit/TinyWireM)

## Installation

1. Change directory to your Arduino sketch directory
2. cd libraries
3. mkdir LiquidCrystal_SSD1306
4. cd LiquidCrystal_SSD1306
5. git clone https://github.com/McNeight/LiquidCrystal_SSD1306.git .
6. Start Arduino IDE.
7. LiquidCrystal_SSD1306 example is located at, File--->Example--->LiquidCrystal_SSD1306--->HelloWorld
